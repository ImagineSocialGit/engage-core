# InternalNotifications Module

This module reference owns the detailed responsibility, dependency, and boundary notes for this module. Keep global architectural rules in `docs/module-boundaries.md`; keep actionable backlog in `docs/TODO.md`.

InternalNotifications is a reusable capability module.

InternalNotifications owns team-facing notifications and notification preferences.

InternalNotifications owns:

- team members
- team member notification preferences
- internal notification gate
- internal notification channel resolver
- internal notification recipient objects
- internal notification scheduling action
- internal notification preference resolvers
- inbound-message notification listener
- TeamMember-specific Messaging adapters

InternalNotifications may depend on Messaging.

InternalNotifications may conditionally integrate with InboundMessaging through events/listeners when both modules are enabled.

InternalNotifications contributes TeamMember support to Messaging through:

- `TeamMemberMessageRecipientGate`
- `TeamMemberMessageRecipientPayloadProvider`

Core contacts should not know about TeamMembers.

Good:

    InternalNotifications -> Messaging contract

Bad:

    Messaging -> InternalNotifications model
