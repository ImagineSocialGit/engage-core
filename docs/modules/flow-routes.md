# FlowRoutes Module

This module reference owns the detailed responsibility, dependency, and boundary notes for this module. Keep global architectural rules in `docs/module-boundaries.md`; keep actionable backlog in `docs/TODO.md`.

FlowRoutes is optional and depends on Workflow.

Use the term `FlowRoutes`.

Do not casually call this domain “flows,” because that creates confusion with Workflow.

FlowRoutes owns:

- `FlowRoute`
- `FlowRoutePoint`
- `Point`
- `ContactFlowRouteProgress`
- route/point automation behavior
- active route execution state
- route cancellation/superseding behavior
- point execution behavior
- wait/resume behavior
- condition/branch evaluation behavior
- external event start behavior
- external event wait/resume behavior
- FlowRoute preset sync

FlowRoute preset sync assumes required Campaign definitions already exist when a route uses campaign points.

Status-triggered FlowRoutes also assume required ContactStatus definitions already exist.

Normal setup should use the app-level `presets:sync` command so dependencies are created first.

FlowRoutes depends on Workflow for status-triggered route behavior.

FlowRoutes also listens to the generic `AutomationEventRecorded` seam for automation-event-triggered routes and event waits.

FlowRoutes should have exactly these broad listener categories:

1. Workflow lifecycle events, such as `ContactWorkflowStatusChanged`.
2. Generic automation events, such as `AutomationEventRecorded`.

Workflow lifecycle events are allowed to stay direct because they start, supersede, and evaluate route progress based on ContactStatus.

Automation-worthy producer outcomes should go through `AutomationEventRecorded`.

FlowRoutes should not add producer-specific listeners for Webinars, Tasks, Mortgage, Campaigns, Broadcasts, or other vertical modules.

Core should not call FlowRoutes.

Workflow should not call FlowRoutes directly.

Expected status-triggered direction:

1. Contact status/profile changes through Workflow.
2. Workflow records the change.
3. Workflow emits an event.
4. FlowRoutes listens/reacts.
5. FlowRoutes supersedes active route progress if needed.
6. FlowRoutes evaluates whether the new ContactStatus has a FlowRoute.
7. FlowRoutes starts or advances route execution if appropriate.

Expected automation-event-triggered direction:

1. Producer module records its own domain state.
2. Producer module emits `AutomationEventRecorded`.
3. FlowRoutes maps that event to `FlowRouteExternalEvent`.
4. FlowRoutes starts matching active routes whose preset trigger is the automation event.
5. FlowRoutes also resumes any existing progress waiting at matching `event_wait` points.
6. FlowRoutes executes route points through DB-owned definitions.

Examples:

    webinar.attended -> FlowRoutes event-triggered route -> enroll_campaign(webinar_attended_nurture)
    webinar.missed -> FlowRoutes event-triggered route -> enroll_campaign(webinar_missed_nurture)
    task.completed -> FlowRoutes event_wait resume, if configured

Current tables/models:

    flow_routes
    points
    flow_route_points
    contact_flow_route_progress

Current models:

    FlowRoute
    Point
    FlowRoutePoint
    ContactFlowRouteProgress

A `ContactStatus` may have at most one active status-triggered FlowRoute.

Automation-event-triggered FlowRoutes do not require `contact_status_id`.

Runtime meaning:

    ContactStatus may have one status-triggered FlowRoute
    Automation event keys may trigger active event-triggered FlowRoutes
    FlowRoute has many FlowRoutePoints
    FlowRoutePoint belongs to Point
    ContactFlowRouteProgress records active/waiting/completed/cancelled execution state

FlowRoutes runtime behavior should read DB-owned route/point definitions.

Preset config may create/update DB-owned FlowRoute definitions, but runtime execution should not depend directly on config definitions.

Current point handler capabilities include:

- noop
- wait
- condition
- branch_evaluate
- event_wait
- create_task
- send_message
- change_status
- enroll_campaign
- cancel_campaign

FlowRoutes may create Tasks through public task-facing services/contracts.

FlowRoutes `create_task` points may create assigned or unassigned tasks.

FlowRoutes should pass task responsibility fields through `CreateTaskAction` rather than encoding responsibility only in FlowRoute metadata.

FlowRoutes may use Messaging only through public Messaging actions/services.

FlowRoutes may use Campaigns only through public Campaigns actions/services.

Good:

    CreateTaskAction
    DispatchMessageAction
    TransitionContactWorkflowStatusAction
    EnrollContactInCampaignAction
    CancelCampaignEnrollmentAction

Bad:

    Task::create(...)
    ScheduledMessage::create(...)
    CampaignEnrollment::create(...)

Also bad:

    Webinars imports FlowRoutes
    Tasks completion listener inside FlowRoutes
    Producer modules call FlowRouteExternalEvent::make(...)

`contact_flow_route_progress` may store denormalized `contact_id` and nullable `contact_status_id` values for query/runtime convenience.

Those fields do not make FlowRoutes the owner of Contact or ContactStatus.

Canonical ownership remains:

- Contact belongs to Core.
- ContactStatus belongs to Core.
- ContactWorkflowProfile belongs to Workflow.
- ContactFlowRouteProgress belongs to FlowRoutes.

For automation-event-started routes, `contact_status_id` and `contact_workflow_profile_id` may be null on `contact_flow_route_progress`.

That is expected.

It means the route started from an automation event rather than a Workflow status transition.
